README of Project 2

For this project I created a simple number generating application that will provide you with lottery numbers

I was inspired by my Project 1 assignment where I built an application that generated a random number a user would try to guess.

Staying with the builtin Random function I was able to expand upon the generating of random numbers and create something that would generate and sort number within a certain range [1-69].


In order to execute the application you will simply type the file name (lotto.py) into the terminal. 
Example: C:\> python lotto.py

by pressing the enter button you will execute the script and your lotto picks will be presented. 


I researched code on stackoverflow and was able to find some helpful information in which I tailored to the needs of this project. The information I used can be found at: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54846420/python-random-lottery-number-generator-game
