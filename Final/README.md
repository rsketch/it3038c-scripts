# Marvel Character Descriptions

### Introduction
This is a python application that will provide you with a description of your favorite Marvel character straight from the Marvel api. 

### Getting Started
After you have the code saved on your machine the first thing you will need to do is get a set of keys from the Marvel api webstie: https://developer.marvel.com/
for the sake of this project I included my keys, but in a real world situation you would want to keep the keys secured.

once you have your keys you will want to install the marvel package by typing: pip install marvel. 
once this is install open a terminal and navigate to the folder that has the marvelChars.py file.
execute the coomand python marvelChars.py (if that fails try python3 marvelChars.py) and press enter.

You will be prompted to type a character name, if you misspell the name don't worry you will get another chance.

If you have spelled the name correctly you will get a description of the character straight from the Marvel api. 

### Why i think this is useful
I am a huge fan of Marvel, I love learning about new or even old characters I did know about. This is a useful tool if you have ever wondered how Marvel would describe thier characters

### Resources 
The resource I used for this project was a video from "Code First with Hala" on youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCwm9-7dy04&t=717s
